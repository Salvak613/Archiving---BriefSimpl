Console

It's a text-based interface that lets you communicate with your system.

Terminal

It's a program that emulates a console.
It displays text, lets you type commands, and sends them to a shell.

Shell

A shell is the program that interprets the commands you type.
It acts as a middle layer between you and the operating system.
The shell reads your input, runs the appropriate programs, and shows their output.

Commands and Arguments

A command is an instruction you give to the shell (usually the name of a program).
It can be followed by arguments (or options) that modify how it works.
