Console

It's a text-based interface that lets you communicate with your system.

Terminal

A terminal is a program that emulates a console.
It displays text, lets you type commands, and sends them to a shell.
Examples: Terminal (macOS), GNOME Terminal (Linux), Windows Terminal (Windows).

Shell

A shell is the program that interprets the commands you type.
It acts as a middle layer between you and the operating system.
The shell reads your input, runs the appropriate programs, and shows their output.
Examples: Bash, Zsh, PowerShell.

Commands and Arguments

A command is an instruction you give to the shell — usually the name of a program.
It can be followed by arguments (or options) that modify how it works.

Example:

ls -l /home

ls → the command (lists files)

-l → an option (detailed view)

/home → an argument (the directory to list)

When you press Enter, the shell parses the command, finds the program (ls), and executes it with the given arguments.
